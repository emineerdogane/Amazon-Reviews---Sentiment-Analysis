Sentiment Analysis of Amazon Reviews using NLP

In recent years, checking customer reviews from fellow shoppers has become an essential part of consumers' decision-making process especially when purchasing products online. It helps customers to learn more about the product and decide if it is the right product for them or not. Amazon, one of the world's largest e-commerce platforms, has a vast amount of product reviews that can be analyzed to extract valuable insights. Analyzing sentiments related to an Amazon product can be fun and difficult especially since the data is collected across various demographics around the world. Analyzing these sentiments not only helps sellers serve the customers better but can also reveal a lot of customer traits present/hidden in the reviews.
The expected outcomes of this research are a dataset of Amazon reviews with sentiment labels, a comparison of the performance of different NLP techniques and machine learning algorithms, and insights and recommendations for Amazon sellers and buyers.
This research proposal aims to conduct a sentiment analysis of Amazon review data using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The primary objectives of this research are:
1.	To preprocess Amazon review data retrieved from Kaggle.com.
2.	To preprocess the collected data by removing stop words, stemming, and lemmatizing the text.
3.	To conduct sentiment analysis on the collected data using various NLP techniques.
4.	To evaluate the performance of different machine learning algorithms for sentiment analysis on Amazon review data.
5.	To provide insights and recommendations based on the sentiment analysis results.

The dataset will be retrieved from Kaggle.com (https://www.kaggle.com/code/halimedogan).
Data contains one product and its reviews. There are 4914 unique customers and reviews about one product (asin ID: B007WTAJTO) between 01/09/2012 and 12/07/2014. The dataset contains the following columns:
